I am currently a 4th-year PhD student of [VAI Lab](http://vai-lab.com/) at the School of Computer Science and Technology, Wuhan University of Science and Technology, extremely fortunate to be supervised by Prof. [Xin Xu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DtuoAWIAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). 

My research interests lie in nighttime scene understanding, such as low-light salient object detection, nighttime semantic segmentation, and adverse weather semantic segmentation.
If you are seeking any form of academic cooperation on nighttime scene understanding, please feel free to email at wangshiqin@wust.edu.cn.

[Low-Light Salient Object Detection Meets the Small Size](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10658986/)

**Shiqin Wang**, Xin Xu*, Haoyang Chen, Kui Jiang, Zheng Wang, and Ke Tang

**TETCI**, 2024

[**Github**](https://github.com/Shiqin-Wang/LS-SOD) [**PDF**](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10658986/)

- This paper proposes a new and realistic task, i.e., LS-SOD, which remains largely ignored in the SOD community. Further, to promote the development of the LS-SOD task, this paper proposes the first real LS-SOD dataset, i.e., LSPV, for research and evaluation.
